To add your own files or texture packs:

Create a new folder with your textures -> execute the png_reader.py [texture_pack] file found in generator_scripts/ -> wait for the colorscripts to be created -> go to minecraft-colorscripts.sh and modify the SELECTED_PACK variable to the texture pack you want (default texture pack is default) -> Enjoy!!
