# minecraft-colorscripts
Some scripts to print out images of minecraft to the terminal. Heavily inspired by [Pokemon-colorscripts](https://github.com/nuke-dash/pokemon-colorscripts-mac/)

Work in progress. Please report any bug you find.

# Known bugs
Not all blocks are available due to transparency erros. Will be fixed in the near future (or not).
