# minecraft-colorscripts
Some scripts to print out images of minecraft to the terminal. Heavily inspired by [Pokemon-colorscripts](https://github.com/nuke-dash/pokemon-colorscripts-mac/)

Work in progress. Please report any bug you find.

# Installation
Download the code from this repository or git clone

```
git clone https://github.com/Axistorm1/minecraft-colorscripts.git
```
cd into the directory and run the install script (using sudo if necessary)

```
cd minecraft-colorscripts
sudo ./install.sh
```
It should be installed, if not, run the commands in the install.sh manually. You can check by running

```
minecraft-colorscripts
```
Which should print the help page for the program

# Known bugs
Not all blocks are available due to transparency erros. Will be fixed in the near future (or not).
